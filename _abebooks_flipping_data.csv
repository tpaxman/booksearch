CONWAY, GORDON (1894 1956). Gordon Conway, artist, only child of John Catlett and Tommie (Johnson) Conway, was born at Cleburne, Texas, on December 18, 1894. Her father descended from colonial and revolutionary era patriots in Tidewater Virginia that included a collateral ancestral line from the mother of President James Madison. After the Civil War he moved to Texas, where he succeeded in business, became an active Episcopal layman, and served as mayor of Cleburne. Around 1900 the family moved to Dallas, where he expanded his chain of lumberyards, established lumber firms in Dallas and Fort Worth, and became a well-known civic and social leader before his death in 1906. His daughter, Gordon, the last of the family line, had no children from a seven-year marriage to businessman Blake Ozias that ended in divorce in France in 1927. Gordon Conway's mother also descended from early American leaders, including the Samuel Adams family of Massachusetts and Joseph Johnson, the first Virginia governor elected by a vote of the people. One Johnson line later moved to Texas and settled in Whitesboro, Paris, and Cleburne. Tommie Johnson Conway established the pattern of a glamorous, nomadic lifestyle that included sporadic educational efforts for Gordon at the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C., a Lausanne girls' school, and brief art lessons in Rome. She was a champion of her daughter's career and her lifelong companion. Slight gutter crack on pages 24-25. Size: Artist Biography / art Works / Art History Catalog. Illustration / Exhibition.

First Edition Thus. 2007. liv, 157pp. ""David Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, first published in 1779, is one of the most influential works in the philosophy of religion and the most artful instance of philosophical dialogue since the dialogues of Plato. It presents a fictional conversation between a sceptic, an orthodox Christian, and a Newtonian theist concerning evidence for the existence of an intelligent cause of nature based on observable features of the world. This edition presents it together with several of Hume's other, shorter writings about religion, and with brief selections from the work of Pierre Bayle, who influenced both Hume's views on religion and the dialectical style of the Dialogues. The volume is completed by an introduction which sets the Dialogues in its philosophical and historical contexts. "" The book is in excellent condition. All contents are tight and clean.

Following his tenure as the youngest-ever director of the National Gallery, Kenneth Clark was appointed Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Oxford. He achieved renown for his distinctive, elegant delivery, later writing and presenting the landmark BBC television series 'Civilisation' in 1969. Landscape into Art gathers together his Oxford lectures on the origins and development of landscape painting. With his prodigious knowledge and passionate, plain-speaking style, Clark is a superb guide. Though his approach is chronological, his aim was not to set down the history of the art form but to explore our changing relationship with nature and evolving attitudes towards its visual representation   from admiration in ancient Greece and Rome, through aversion and fear in the medieval era, to a renewed ardour in the 19th century. In each themed chapter, he considers the narrative, formal and intellectual factors underlying key developments, such as 'The Landscape of Symbols' and the 'Landscape of Fantasy'. As Will Gompertz   BBC Arts Editor and one of the world's leading experts on modern art   writes in his introduction, Clark 'passionately believed art could be a force for good, that it had a civilising, enriching and mind-altering power'. In his lectures, Clark combined this heartfelt conviction with expert scholarly analysis, adeptly moving from broad conceptual themes to superb commentaries on individual artists such as Turner, Bellini and Constable. This wonderful edition illuminates the text with more colour illustrations than ever before, including celebrated works such as Bruegel's Winter, The Dark Day and Mondrian's Composition 10 in Black and White. It also includes the author's preface from the 1976 edition. UK Postage £3.40; Airmail to USA and Canada £24.20; Airmail to Rest of the World (except the EU), £24.20.

ABOUT THIS BOOK: Sir Kenneth Clark possesses a rare ability for conveying artistic enthusiasm to those who might never encounter his more learned studies and catalogues. In 'Landscape into Art' he effectively outlines the growth of landscape painting as an independent art, from the early use of symbols taken from nature to the canvases of such great painters as Constable and Corot, Turner and Van Gogh, Cezanne and Seurat. And today - what changes of survival, he asks, has the image of an enclosed garden in an age of slide rules and nuclear power?(Publisher).

"BROKEN EAR, The : The Adventures of Tintin (L'oreille cassee)",Herge (English Language Edition),13.88,USD,Elizabeth's Bookshops,Fremantle,WA,Australia,"Softcover. Condition: Fine. The Broken Ear (1937) is the story of a thrilling pursuit. Tintin sets off to South America to retrieve a stolen fetish. There, all sorts of interests are in conflict: military, economic and the war of the Gran Chaco which had been opposing Bolivia and Paraguay for the past three years. A small Arumbaya statue has been stolen in a museum, then returned. One little detail though will tell Tintin that instead of the original, a mere replica was returned. There must be a secret hiding behind this small statue since its robbery was carefully concealed. This is in South America that Tintin will find the key to this enigma. #1219R/0420/0621/260722/20123 SCARCE US EDITIONThe Broken EarÂ(French:ÂL'Oreille cassÃ e, originally published in English asÂTintin and the Broken Ear) is the sixth volume ofÂThe Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by the Belgian cartoonistÂHergÃ . Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaperÂLe VingtiÃ me SiÃ cleÂfor its children's supplementÂLe Petit VingtiÃ me, it was serialised weekly from December 1935 to February 1937. The story tells of young Belgian reporterÂTintinÂand his dogÂSnowy, as he searches for a South AmericanÂfetish, identifiable by its broken right ear, and pursues thieves who have stolen it. In doing so, he ends up in the fictional nation ofÂSan Theodoros, where he becomes embroiled in a war and discovers theÂArumbayaÂtribe deep in the forest.The Broken EarÂwas a commercial success and was published in book form shortly after its conclusion. HergÃ continuedÂThe Adventures of TintinÂwithÂThe Black Island, while the series itself became a defining part of theÂFranco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1943,ÂThe Broken EarÂwas coloured and reformatted for republication byÂCasterman. Commentators have praised the book for showcasing HergÃ 's then-newfound commitment to a clear narrative structure and strives for historical and technical accuracy, but believe that its use of humour comparable to earlierÂAdventuresÂrenders it inferior to the previous volume,ÂThe Blue Lotus.ÂThe Broken EarÂintroduces the recurring characterÂGeneral Alcazar, and was the first to include fictional countries. The story was adapted for both the 1956ÂBelvisionÂanimation,ÂHergÃ 's Adventures of Tintin, and for the 1991ÂEllipse/NelvanaÂanimated seriesÂThe Adventures of Tintin.AÂfetishÂcreated by theÂArumbayaÂtribe ofÂSouth AmericaÂis stolen from Brussels' Museum ofÂEthnography, only to be returned the following day. Tintin realizes that the replacement is a fake, and draws a connection with a local sculptor, Jacob Balthazar, who has just been murdered. Balthazar's parrot â "" the only witness to the murder â "" is obtained by two Hispanic men, Alonso and RamÃ n, who try to kill Tintin when he begins to investigate their connection to the crime.[1]ÂFrom the parrot, Alonso and RamÃ n discover Balthazar's murderer is Rodrigo Tortilla, and they proceed to follow him aboard a ship bound for South America. There, they murder Tortilla, but find that he didn't have the original fetish. Tintin, however, follows them, and arranges their arrest when the ship docks at Los Dopicas, capital ofÂSan Theodoros.[2]ÂNevertheless, the corrupt colonel in charge of the arrest allows the antagonists to slip away, and detains Tintin.In the city, Tintin is framed as a terrorist, arrested, and sentenced to death by firing squad. Tintin survives when a revolution topples the government, and the new leader, General Alcazar, appoints Tintin to be his aide-de-camp. Alonso and RamÃ n capture Tintin, and interrogate him in the hope of locating the missing fetish, but they only end up briefly put behind bars by him.[3]ÂAs aide-de-camp, Tintin opposes the proposed decision of San Theodoros claiming the supposedly oil rich Gran Chapo, as this would cause a war between San Theodoros and neighboring Nuevo Rico, and he is framed as a traitor by warmongering oil and weapon companies. Nevertheless, Tintin's new friendÂPabloÂfrees him from imprisonment, allowing for Tintin to flee to Nuevo Rico.[4]ÂHowever, in the process, he inadvertently causes events that, partially as its government considered claiming Gran Chapo for its oil as well, have Nuevo Rico start a war between it and San Theodoros. Once within Nuevo Rico, Tintin decides to enter the forest and find the Arumbaya tribe, hoping they can explain to him why people wish to steal the fetish. Finding a British explorer, Ridgewell, living among the Arumbaya, Tintin learns that a diamond was hidden inside the statue.[5]As the war between San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico ends when Gran Chapo is discovered to have no oil, Tintin returns to Belgium after a brief encounter with Alonso and RamÃ n. There, Tintin discovers Balthazar's brother has been producing a range of exact replicas of the fetish, which he had discovered among his deceased brother's belongings. Tintin learns it was purchased from him by Samuel Goldbarr, a wealthy American now returning to theÂUnited StatesÂwith it by ship. Catching up to the boat, Tintin finds Alonso and RamÃ n aboard. His struggle with them for the possession of the fetish results in it smashing on the floor, upon which the diamond hidden in it rolls overboard into the sea. Alonso and RamÃ n try to kill Tintin for making them lose it, and the three of them accidentally fall overboard as well. Tintin is rescued, but Alonso and RamÃ n drown. Goldbarr allows Tintin to return the stolen fetish to the museum, where it is repaired and put back on display, albeit comically damaged.[6] Elizabeth's Bookshops have been one of Australia's premier independent book dealers since 1973.

Historical imitation was ending and artists were embracing new styles, forms, and materials. The lavish variety of products~textiles, typography, bookbinding, furniture, jewelry, ceramics, glass, and ironwork~are fully described and illustrated in Professor Pevsner's account. The era began with William Morris' attempts to re~establish the aesthetic value of items of everyday use, and continued with Art Nouveau and its campaign to drive out historicism. Art Nouveau was shortlived because its interest in harmonizing the individual piece with its setting was antithetical to mass production. It gave way, first in Austria and Germany, to the idealization of the straight line. Later, the new machine style was extolled by the Futurists in Italy and the Bauhaus in Germany. In architecture, the threads of development of this critical era include advances in the use of iron in construction; the Chicago school and the first skyscrapers; the Domestic Revival in England and its concentration on private houses; the extravagances of Art Nouveau, culminating in Gaud, Coignet, Perret, and Garnier and their pioneering work with reinforced concrete in France; and Behrens, Loos, and Gropius with their functional style, expressive of a machine age. As the twentieth century began, the growing city became more and more a concern, and modern city planning emerged in the ideas of Garnier and Sant'Elia and in the garden city experiments in England. Professor Pevsner concludes that, with the new century, architects and designers became aware of and accepted social responsibility, in contrast to the painters, who became more isolated and alienated.

Final charges may vary depending on size and weight. ""Bryson's contributors celebrate aeronautics and evolution; suspension bridges and systematic biology; X-ray crystallography and lightning conductors; Bayesian distribution and Bakelite; climate science and complexity theory. This is a book of cerebral riches, heavy with history, to be consumed at leisure. It is also beautifully illustrated. All but one of its 22 contributors wrote specially for this anthology. Richard Holmes, fresh from his scientific history The Age of Wonder, provides new material on 18th-century balloon flights. Richard Dawkins sums up the significance of Darwin's achievement with renewed metaphorical force. The Natural History Museum palaeontologist Richard Fortey highlights the importance of collections; Steve Jones raises some of the puzzles of biodiversity; the physicist and science fiction author Gregory Benford contemplates the enigma of time. Every now and then, the book begins to seem like a royal variety performance: well-known acts trip on to the stage, perform a much-loved routine and disappear, to be followed by something completely different yet equally familiar. But all contributors in their different ways also remind us that the show goes on. Do we see more clearly than Hooke and Newton did three and a half centuries ago? Oliver Morton argues that we may have traded one picture of the Earth for another, but our understanding of the globe remains incomplete; Ian Stewart reminds us that for all Galileo's astuteness, even scientists can be oblivious to the subtle mathematics that underpin their research; John Barrow considers the apparent simplicity of cosmological physics and points out that we do not observe the laws of nature, we see only the outcomes of those laws. 'Outcomes are much more complicated than the laws that govern them.' The physicist and astrobiologist Paul Davies reminds us that even the keystone of the Copernican revolution - the assumption that there is nothing special about us - might be incompletely laid. Is the solar system typical? Perhaps, but supporting evidence began to emerge only 15 years ago, and carbon-based life exists on Earth but, as far as we know, nowhere else. Is there anything typical about our position in spacetime? Davies has his doubts; carbon, manufactured by burning stars, was not possible for the first five billion years, and may not be possible 100 billion years from now, although the universe could drag on, getting ever colder and darker, for another 10 billion billion empty years. Gregory Benford makes the same point: 'We seem to occupy an unusual niche in the long history of this universe.' The novelist Maggie Gee takes global warming as a text for an entertaining sermon on fiction's love affair with apocalypse. The astronomer Martin Rees, president of the Royal Society, who in a 2003 book warned that we might already have begun Our Final Century, is sure that many mysteries remain. 'Most of the questions still being addressed simply couldn't have been posed 50 years ago (or even 20): we can't conceive what problems will engage our successors."" - Tim Radford in The Guardian.

From lower cover: Join Bill Bryson on an unforgettable exploration of scientific genius, discovery, and invention. Edited and introduced by Bryson, with original contributions from ""a glittering array of scientific writing talent"" (Sunday Observer), Seeing Further tells the spectacular story of modern science through the lens of the international Royal Society, founded on a damp November night in London in 1660. Isaac Newton, John Locke, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking -- all have been fellows. Its members have split the atom, discovered the double helix and the electron, and given us the computer and the World Wide Web.

Shakespeare: The World As A Stage: Bill Bryson,Bill Bryson,1.0,USD,WorldofBooks,Goring-By-Sea,WS,United Kingdom,"Paperback. Condition: Very Good. From bestselling author Bill Bryson comes this compelling short biography of William Shakespeare, our greatest dramatist and poet. Examining centuries of myths, half-truths and downright lies, Bill Bryson makes sense of the man behind the masterpieces. As he leads us through the crowded streets of Elizabethan England, he brings to life the places and characters that inspired Shakespeare's work. Along the way he delights in the inventiveness of Shakespeare's language, which has given us so many of the indispensable words and phrases we use today, and celebrates the Bard's legacy to our literature, culture and history. Drawing together information from a vast array of sources, this is a masterful account of the life and works of William Shakespeare, one of the most famous and most enigmatic people ever to have lived - not to mention a classic piece of Bill Bryson. The book has been read, but is in excellent condition. Pages are intact and not marred by notes or highlighting. The spine remains undamaged.

Shakespeare: The World as a Stage (Eminent Lives),Bill Bryson,1.0,USD,WorldofBooks,Goring-By-Sea,WS,United Kingdom,"Paperback. Condition: Very Good. In this much anticipated addition to the Eminent Lives series, Bill Bryson's biography of William Shakespeare unravels the superstitions, academic discoveries and myths surrounding the life of our greatest poet and playwright. Shakespeare's life, despite the scrutiny of generations of biographers and scholars, is still a thicket of myths and traditions, some preposterous, some conflicting, arranged around the few scant facts known about the Bard - from his birth in Stratford to the bequest of his second best bed to his wife when he died. Following his international bestsellers 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' and 'The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid', Bill Bryson has written a short biography of William Shakespeare for the Eminent Lives series - which seeks to pair great subjects with writers known for their strong sensibilities and sharp, lively points of view. The book has been read, but is in excellent condition. Pages are intact and not marred by notes or highlighting. The spine remains undamaged.

Despite Straight Lines.,"Albers, Josef. [Henri Cartier-Bresson]",2000.0,USD,Raptis Rare Books,Palm Beach,FL,U.S.A.,"First edition of this work by the famed artist. Octavo, original boards. Association copy, inscribed by the author to Henri Cartier-Bresson, ""For Henry Cartier-Bresson Josef Albers May 20, â  68."" Cartier-Bresson was working for Magnum Photographers when he photographed Josef Albers at his home in Connecticut in May of 1968. An outstanding association copy, linking Albers, one of the great abstract artists of the 20th century and Henri Cartier-Bresson, one of the finest photographers. Also, laid in is a card signed by Albers. Henri Cartier-Bresson is perhaps the greatest photographer of the twentieth century, The Europeans, along with The Decisive Moment are his finest books. Henri Cartier-Bresson's amazing feat as a photographer is the ability to follow his heart and the keen vision of his mind and eye in each photograph. His subjects are only part of the image in the viewfinder, whose composition he sometimes arranges with geometric precision. Many of his best photographs also have startlingly broad political and sociological connotations, which gives the ordinary subjects extraordinary dignity, even grandeur.

Gebraucht - Wie neu -This is a different kind of CSS book. It takes the approach that there's a real connection between craftsmanship and Web design. Handcrafted CSS gives frustrated Web designers the ammo they need to convince their clients and bosses to adopt innovative and effective CSS techniques that make their lives easier while improving the end user's experience. This book offers designers a transitional approach that teaches them when it's OK to push the envelope a bit, how best to do it, and when not to. The book's seven chapters deconstruct various aspects of a case-study Web site, focusing on aspects that make it bulletproof and demonstrate progressive enrichment techniques over more traditional labor-intensive methods. Subjects include building for unanticipated future use; progressively enriching designs using CSS3 properties that work today; the magic and flexibility of using RGB color with an alpha channel; modular float management, crafting flexible frameworks; fluid layouts using grid-based design principles; and craftsmanship details on typography, jQuery, and shifting backgrounds. 217 pp. Englisch.

Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good Dust Jacket. Cover has some light edge and corner wear. ; Twice in the final years of his life, Elder Neal A. Maxwell told a grandson of Henry Eyring's, ""You need to write your grandfather's story."" This is that story of Henry Eyring, perhaps the Church's most acclaimed scientist. It is a book about science and Mormonism, written to be easily understood by newcomers to both subjects. It demonstrates why one of the Church's highest- profile intellectuals was also one of its humblest believers. In fact, this story of Henry Eyring shows how intellect and belief go hand- in- hand and how simple, faithful people can change the world. ; 1.2 x 9.1 x 6.1 Inches; 330 pages; ",Hardcover,UsedCondition,,9781590388549,"Deseret Book, Salt Lake City, UT",2008.0,InStock,abebooks - eyring - mormon scientist,False,False

Jenseits von Eden. Roman. Aus dem Amerikanischen Harry Kahn. Titel der amerikanischen Originalausgabe: East of Eden. Mit bio- und bibliographischen Hinweisen.,"Steinbeck, John:",4.59,USD,BOUQUINIST,München,BY,Germany,"Condition: Sehr gut. Lizenza des Diana Verlags. 701 (3) Seiten. 19,2 x 12,5 cm. Dünndruckausgabe. Einband von Stefan Kortemeier. Sehr guter Zustand. Von der Mitte des letzten Jahrhunderts bis zum Ende des Ersten Weltkriegs reicht die Zeitspanne, die diese große amerikanische Familiensaga umfaßt. Sie erzählt die Geschichte der Trasks und der Hamiltons: die Geschichte von Charles und Adam, den ungleichen Brüdern, die um die Liebe ihres Vaters buhlen und den Reizen derselben Frau erliegen. Von eben jener Cathy die ihren Mann und die neugeborenen Zwillinge verläßt, um sich ihren Lebensunterhalt in einem Bordell zu verdienen. Und von Aron und Caleb, ihren beiden Söhnen, deren spannungsgeladenes Verhältnis in einer modernen Version des biblischen Kainsmythos gipfelt. - John Ernst Steinbeck (* 27. Februar 1902 in Salinas, Kalifornien;   20. Dezember 1968 in New York) gehört zu den erfolgreichsten US-amerikanischen Autoren des 20. Jahrhunderts. Er schrieb zahlreiche Romane, Kurzgeschichten und Novellen, arbeitete zeitweilig auch als Journalist und war im Zweiten Weltkrieg 1943 als Kriegsberichterstatter tätig. 1940 erhielt er den Pulitzer-Preis für seinen Roman Früchte des Zorns und 1962 den Nobelpreis für Literatur. . Zu Steinbecks Werk: John Steinbeck gehört zu den meistgelesenen amerikanischen Autoren des 20. Jahrhunderts, innerhalb wie außerhalb der USA. Kritik und Literaturwissenschaft beurteilten sein Werk jedoch eher distanziert. Bereits die Verleihung des Nobelpreises im Jahr 1962  für seine einmalige realistische und phantasievolle Erzählkunst, gekennzeichnet durch mitfühlenden Humor und sozialen Scharfsinn"", wie es in der Begründung hieß, stieß bei den meisten Literaturkritikern auf Unverständnis. Heute spielen Steinbecks Werke im amerikanischen Literaturkanon kaum mehr eine Rolle, mit Ausnahme der Bücher Früchte des Zorns und Von Mäusen und Menschen, die in vielen englischsprachigen Ländern von Kanada bis Australien zur Schullektüre gehören. . .

East of Eden (Penguin Modern Classics),Mr John Steinbeck,7.25,USD,WorldofBooks,Goring-By-Sea,WS,United Kingdom,"Paperback. Condition: Very Good. 'There is only one book to a man,' Steinbeck wrote of East of Eden, his most ambitious novel. Set in the rich farmland of the Salinas Valley, California, this powerful, often brutal novel, follows the intertwined destinies of two families - the Trasks and the Hamiltons - whose generations hopelessly re-enact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel. Here Steinbeck created some of his most memorable characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity; the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. The book has been read, but is in excellent condition. Pages are intact and not marred by notes or highlighting. The spine remains undamaged.

The Robot in the Garden: Telerobotics and Telepistemology in the Age of the Internet (Leonardo Book Series),Ken Goldberg,10.83,USD,Libros Tobal,Ajalvir,MADRI,Spain,"Encuadernación de tapa dura. Condition: Bien. Texto en inglés. Tapa dura con sobrecubierta de editorial ilustrada. Como nuevo. The Robot in the Garden initiates a critical theory of telerobotics and introduces telepistemology, the study of knowledge acquired at a distance. Many of our most influential technologies, the telescope, telephone, and television, were developed to provide knowledge at a distance. Telerobots, remotely controlled robots, facilitate action at a distance. Specialists use telerobots to explore actively environments such as Mars, the Titanic, and Chernobyl. Military personnel increasingly employ reconnaissance drones and telerobotic missiles. At home, we have remote controls for the garage door, car alarm, and television (the latter a remote for the remote).The Internet dramatically extends our scope and reach. Thousands of cameras and robots are now accessible online. Although the role of technical mediation has been of interest to philosophers since the seventeenth century, the Internet forces a reconsideration. As the public gains access to telerobotic instruments previously restricted to scientists and soldiers, questions of mediation, knowledge, and trust take on new significance for everyday life.Telerobotics is a mode of representation. But representations can misrepresent. If Orson Welles's 'War of the Worlds' was the defining moment for radio, what will be the defining moment for the Internet? As artists have always been concerned with how representations provide us with knowledge, the book also looks at telerobotics' potential as an artistic medium.The seventeen essays, by leading figures in philosophy, art, history, and engineering, are organized into three sections: Philosophy; Art, History, and Critical Theory; and Engineering, Interface, and System Design.

Published in Antwerp in 1570, it did something no previous book had done: here was the world in all its component parts, the chance to see our planet as a place of staggering variety and ultimate unity. It was the world's first ever atlas. Brainchild of Abraham Ortelius, the 'Theatrum' reflected the great vitality of the era, the prevailing zest for exploration and discovery, and the linked activities of international commerce and map-making. In his native city of Antwerp, then the world's liveliest port, Ortelius was member of a circle of extraordinary men including the age's most eminent printer, Chrisophe Plantin, and greatest geographer, Gerard Mercator. His warm, compelling personality meant that his momentous work was born of friendship and collaboration, at a time when the Low Countries were struggling under the brutal yoke of Hapsburg Spain."" - from dust-jacket blurb.

Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good Dust Jacket. Cover has some light edge and corner wear.; During Elder Neal A. Maxwell's conference addresses, many listeners must have wished there were some means to capture and hold those skillfully crafted phrases that mark his stimulating style. With the publication of this book, that wish has been spectacularly granted. The quotations within these pages -- over fifteen hundred in all -- have been selected not only from his addresses but also from his numerous published books. Bearing eloquent gospel witness, they are spread through three hundred subjects. An extensive index further enhances this user-friendly book. And although this volume is formatted as a reference book, the power and focus of the individual quotations are such that the book can be read straight through with both spiritual and intellectual delight. Finding out the deep things of God, said Joseph Smith, requires ""time, and experience, and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts."" That the author has paid the price is evident. For example, of the plan of salvation he writes: ""It does no violence even to our frail human logic to observe that there cannot be a grand plan of salvation for all mankind unless there is also a plan for each individual."" This profound statement gives all of us cause to ponder. And there is much, much more. This book will be of immense value not only to the ordinary reader and in the home but also to teachers of priesthood, Relief Society, and auxiliary classes.

Ink name on endpaper. 2009 Trade Paperback. 287 pp. There are many biographies of John Calvin, the theologian--some villifying him and others extolling his virtues--but few that reveal John Calvin, the man. Professor and renowned Reformation historian Herman Selderhuis has written this book to bring Calvin near to the reader, showing him as a man who had an impressive impact on the development of the Western world, but who was first of all a believer struggling with God and with the way God governed both the world and his own life. Selderhuis draws on Calvin's own publications and commentary on the biblical figures with whom he strongly identified to describe his theology in the context of his personal development. Throughout we see a person who found himself alone at many of the decisive moments of his life--a fact that echoed through Calvin's subsequent sermons and commentaries. Selderhuis's unique and compelling look at John Calvin, with all of his merits and foibles, ultimately discloses a man who could not find himself at home in the world in which he lived.

Fiona Larsen, a waitress in a Copenhagen café, had three years earlier ""adopted"" a little Jewish girl, Rine, now six, ""to earn some easy money. "" She presents her as her niece, but as the round-up of Jews escalates, she realizes that Rine could be found out and that their situation is getting increasingly perilous. She decides that she and the little girl, whom she has grown to love as if she were her own daughter, must flee. - « Agnes Jelhof Jensen came from an Orthodox Jewish home in Denmark. The author of 12 books and the winner of numerous awards. The second youngest of seven children, Mrs. Jensen fled Denmark in 1943 with her husband and eight-month-old son in the Jewish evacuation to Sweden. After the war, Mrs. Jensen, who had remarried, moved from Copenhagen to Edmonton with her new husband and their two young daughters. Except for a short stay in Toronto, Mrs. Jensen was a resident of Edmonton since 1954.
